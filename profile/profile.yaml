# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a recent graduate from the University of Toronto with an Honours Bachelor of Science degree majoring in mathematics and minoring in computer science and statistics. I am proficient in core computer science concepts such as object-oriented programming, data structures/algorithms as well as general software design concepts. I also have a background in working with data from various statistics courses, which includes cleaning data and combining different datasets to make them easier to work with in the analysis process. Throughout my academic career, I have also honed my critical thinking and problem-solving skills on a daily basis. I consider myself someone who has a passion for learning, and what excites me the most about software engineering as a career is that nothing stays static and there are always new technologies to learn. All in all, I am excited to have the opportunity to work with other professionals in the field and apply my skills to industry-level projects.
